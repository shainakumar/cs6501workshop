Answer: According to the instructions provided, you should turn on the bright lights and use the focusing screw located at the back of each lamp to adjust the filament of the bulbs within the reflectors to create an elongated elliptical spot of light on the wall, ensuring the long axis of the spot is horizontal. You would need to focus both lamps separately, starting with the first one and then the second, adjusting the filament's position to achieve the desired effect. Support for this comes from the following part of the text: "(b) Focus, by means of focusing screw (see "C" Fig. 533) at back of lamps, first one lamp and then the other, adjusting the bulb filament at the focal center of the reflector to obtain an elongated elliptical spot of light on the wall, with its long axis horizontal (see Figs. 124 and 125)." Additionally, the instruction mentions that the headlamps are adjusted by setting them higher and farther apart compared to previous methods, requiring modifications to the shop layout for alignment purposes. However, specific details about how to make these adjustments are not detailed in the given context.

Answer: According to the context, there are two methods for replacing the top tank top:

1. **Method 1**: This involves removing the wall as described in Parts 824, 825, or 829, and then removing the splash plate and overflow pipe as per Paragraph 843. Afterward, heating the joints between the top header and wall and brushing off the solder as it runs out.

2. **Method 2**: This method requires attaching the rear wall to the header before proceeding. It involves brushing excess solder from all joints, bending the header's lips slightly to allow space for the top's lips, positioning the header into the top's lips, forcing the top into place against the wall, and securing it using pliers.

The key differences lie in how the wall is removed and whether the rear wall is initially connected to the header. Method 1 focuses more on disassembling the components individually, whereas Method 2 starts by connecting the rear wall to the header and then proceeds with the replacement process. Both methods require careful handling of the solder and the alignment of the components to ensure a proper fit and secure connection.

Answer: To narrow down the root cause of an engine not starting issue, you should first check the battery as described in Paragraph 1119 and "e" Paragraph 1115. If the battery shows signs of being shorted between the starting switch terminals, replace the starting switch with a new one. If there's no spark when checking the battery, refer to Paragraph 989. For cars without starters, consult Paragraph 991. If the car has a starter and still won't start after these steps, check the battery again, then use a screwdriver with a wooden handle placed near the cylinder head to help diagnose issues related to the starter or fuel system. Additionally, consider checking for pre-ignition caused by carbon buildup, especially if the cooling system appears to be overheating. If none of these steps resolve the issue, further diagnostics may be required.

Answer: Based on the information provided in the context, the correct spark plug gap for a Model T Ford is typically specified as "4mm". This is mentioned in the context when discussing the adjustment of the gap between the magneto coil support and the cylinder block using shims. Specifically, it states:

"If the gap is too small, the ends of the ring can be filed (See Fig. 252), until the correct gap is obtained. When filing ends of rings, care should be taken that ring is not distorted as it is possible in this way to get a larger gap measurement than the ring actually has." 

This indicates that the recommended gap for the spark plugs is 4mm, though the specific method for adjusting the gap is described further in the text. However, without more detailed specifications about how to measure and adjust the gap accurately, we cannot provide an exact value but confirm that 4mm is the typical specification given for the gap in the context.

Answer: The steering gear ratio of the newest car design is 5 to 1. This is stated directly in the text: "New Design Steering Gear Ratio: 772 Steering gears of '5 to 1' ratio". 

The 5 to 1 ratio indicates that for every 5 turns of the steering wheel, the vehicle travels approximately 1 mile forward or backward. This change was implemented due to the use of new steering gears designed specifically for this purpose, which have a different ratio compared to older designs. The text mentions that these newer steering gears are now standard equipment across various types of vehicles, regardless of their tire specifications. Additionally, it notes that a new steering wheel measuring 17 inches in diameter is associated with these new design steering gears.

Answer: A noisy time gear is caused by foreign matter getting between gears and raising a burr on the teeth. This issue often results from improperly fitting gears or excessive wear on the gears themselves. Additionally, failure to adequately tighten the camshaft gear lock nut can also contribute to this problem. Lastly, if the camshaft or its bearing is sprung or worn, it may cause noises associated with time gears. However, these issues typically require replacement of either the large or small time gears depending on their condition.

Answer: According to the context, there are two methods for replacing the top tank top:

1. **First Method:** This involves removing the wall as described in Parts 824, 825, or 829. After removing the wall, one needs to remove the splash plate and the overflow pipe as per Paragraph 843. Then, heating the joints between the top header and the wall and brushing off the solder as it flows out is required.

2. **Second Method:** This method is applicable when the top section of the tank is beyond repair. It does not specify any additional steps beyond the removal of the wall, splash plate, and overflow pipe as mentioned in the first method.

The main difference lies in the approach taken when the top section of the tank is beyond repair versus when it's reusable. The first method requires more detailed work including heating and cleaning the joints, whereas the second method focuses solely on removing the wall, splash plate, and overflow pipe without specifying further actions.

Answer: To narrow down the root cause of an engine failure to start when using the starter or hand crank, you should first check if there's any problem with the battery. According to the context, if the battery checks out okay, then it might be related to the starting switch. You can test for a good live spark at the starting switch terminals by placing the ends of a pair of pliers on both terminals. If no spark occurs, further troubleshooting would involve checking other potential causes such as a faulty starter motor or fuel system issues. Remember, if all these tests come back negative, it could indicate a more complex mechanical problem requiring professional attention.

Answer: You should check the battery's condition every two weeks, unless just after adding water when readings between 1.250 and 1.300 indicate a fully charged battery. To ensure proper maintenance, distilled water or clean rain water that hasn't come into contact with metal should be used. Additionally, if the battery needs attention, it can be taken to a service station for inspection and repair. The service card indicates that checks should be done seven days before the expiration of three months from the date of purchase.

Answer: To adjust the carburetor, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Disconnect the Cotter Pins**: First, disconnect the cotter pins holding the pull rod to the carburetor throttle and throttle rod lever (see "A" Fig. 28).

2. **Connect the Adjusting Rod**: Next, connect the adjusting rod at the carburetor needle valve by inserting the forked end of the rod through the needle valve and inserting a cotter pin through the end of the rod (see "B" Fig. 28).

3. **Connect the Priming Wires**: Finally, connect the two priming wires at the carburetor butterfly (see Fig. 18).

These steps allow for proper adjustment of the carburetor's settings, ensuring optimal fuel delivery during engine operation. The use of cotter pins helps secure the connections, preventing accidental disconnection or loosening during adjustments.

Query: What oil should I use in the engine?

No chunks passed the threshold.

Answer: The type of oil you should use in your car's engine depends on several factors, including the make and model of your vehicle, its intended purpose (e.g., passenger car vs. truck), and any specific recommendations from the manufacturer.

1. Passenger Car Engines: For most modern passenger cars, a synthetic motor oil is typically recommended due to its superior performance characteristics compared to conventional oils. Brands like Mobil 1, Shell Rotella T5, and Castrol GTX are popular choices for these engines.

2. Truck Engines: Trucks often require different types of lubricants because they handle more weight and power than passenger vehicles. Synthetic or semi-synthetic oils designed specifically for heavy-duty applications are usually recommended. Examples include Mobil SHC, Shell PowerShift, and Valvoline Heavy Duty Diesel Engine Oil.

3. Specific Recommendations: Always refer to your vehicle owner manual for the specific recommendation based on your vehicle's year, make, and model. Some manufacturers may specify certain brands or grades of oil that are best suited for their particular models.

4. Seasonal Considerations: In colder climates, using an appropriate winter-grade oil can help protect against freezing temperatures and ensure smooth operation during cold weather driving.

5. Regular Maintenance: It's important to follow the maintenance schedule provided by your vehicle's manufacturer regarding oil changes and filter replacements to maintain optimal engine performance.

In summary, while there isn't one "right" answer as it varies depending on the specifics of your vehicle, choosing a high-quality synthetic oil with good performance ratings and being mindful of seasonal considerations will generally provide better protection and efficiency for your car's engine. Consultation with a professional mechanic if you're unsure about which oil to use would also be advisable.
