Question: What causes a noisy time gear?

A noisy time gear can be caused by several factors, including:

(a) Excessively worn gears,
(b) Improperly fitted gears,
(c) Foreign matter getting between gears and raising a burr on the teeth,
(d) Failure to sufficiently tighten camshaft gear lock nut,
(e) Sprung camshaft or badly worn camshaft front bearing. 

The context also mentions that noises which are attributed to time gears can sometimes be due to the generator drive pinion not meshing properly with the large time gear. However, this issue requires careful inspection and may necessitate replacing both large and small time gears if the car has been in service for an extended period. Additionally, removing the commutator case and checking for proper meshing between the generator drive pinion and the large time gear can help diagnose the problem further. The context does not explicitly state that foreign matter causing burrs on the teeth is always the cause of noisy time gears but implies it could be one potential factor among others.
============================================================
Question: What is the difference between the two methods of replacing the top tank top?

According to the context, there are two methods for removing and replacing the top tank top:

1. **First Method**: This method involves removing the wall around the top tank top, heating the joints between the top header and the wall, and brushing off any solder that comes loose. It also mentions using a dent puller if needed.

2. **Second Method**: This method is used when the top section of the tank is beyond repair. It does not specify additional steps but indicates that the top tank top can be reused after removal.

The main difference lies in the approach taken when the top section of the tank is beyond repair versus when it's reusable. The first method requires more detailed preparation (removing the wall, heating the joints, and possibly using a dent puller) before attempting to remove the top tank top, whereas the second method focuses solely on reusing the existing top tank top without requiring such preparatory work.

This aligns with option (c) in the multiple-choice question: "Foreign matter getting between gears and raising a burr on the teeth." 

While options (a), (b), (d), and (e) could potentially contribute to noisy time gears, they are not explicitly stated as the primary cause according to the given text. Thus, the most accurate answer based solely on the provided context is:

A noisy time gear is caused by foreign matter getting between gears and raising a burr on the teeth.
============================================================
Question: What is the difference between the two methods of replacing the top tank top?

The main difference between the two methods of replacing the top tank top lies in how the top is removed:

**Method 1:** This involves removing the entire front or rear wall of the top tank using a hacksaw. Once the top is detached, you heat the joint between the top and the wall, brush off any solder, and hit the top with a hammer at the corners to break it loose under the flange. Finally, you bring the top to heat and remove it by pulling it away from the wall and then lifting it off the overflow pipe.

**Method 2:** In contrast, this method requires cutting through the top with a hacksaw just above the top and header joint, stopping at the flange of the remaining wall. You then heat the joint between the top and the wall, brush off any solder, and hit the top with a hammer at the corners to break it loose under the flange. The top can then be pulled away from the wall and raised off the overflow pipe without needing to remove the overflow pipe itself. 

This method allows for more precise control over the removal process, especially if the top needs to be replaced due to damage rather than simply being reused. The key differences are the approach to cutting the top and the subsequent heating and breaking steps before attempting to remove the top directly.
============================================================
Question: The engine of the car isn't starting, what should I do to narrow down the root cause of this issue?

To narrow down the root cause of the engine not starting issue, you should first check if the car is equipped with a starter. If it is not, refer to Paragraph 991. If the car has a starter:

1. Check the battery as described in Paragraph 1119 and "e" Paragraph 1115.
2. If the engine turns over but the car won't start, refer to Paragraph 989. If the battery checks out okay, try checking the starting switch.
3. If the starting switch is faulty, install a new one according to Paragraph 988.
